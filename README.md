# FASTA-dna-sequence-comparison
takes in 2 FASTA files and compaires all of the DNA sequences of one file to all of the DNA sequences of the other

Function: 
Python program that directly compares two DNA sequences and assigns a similarity score. 

Scoring:
The score is equal to the number of matches between two sequences, divided by the number of positions compared. If at any position, either one of the sequences has a gap, ignores that position in the scoring.

Original Use: 
Compare each São Tomé frog’s sequence to that of each mainland African species and identify the closest three matches. Shows that they all have the same top three matches. This is in order to locate the regions of Africa where these three matching mainland species originate from.
